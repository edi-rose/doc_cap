# Documentation-Capture
Small project to automatically generate a PDF version of our strategyblocks documentation.

# Current State
Bot currently can produce a PDF containing all the documentation on the live site.
Bot is dynamic and will update automatically when new pages are added / removed.
This is based on the links available on the main menu of the documentation. 

# Next Steps
PDF verision needs an added page which can act as an index.
Pages also need to be ordered coherantly, currently done alphabetical. 
Ideally, text would be selectable.
The Risk Management Page acts unexpectadly and needs updating on the live site to be compatatible with the bot.
